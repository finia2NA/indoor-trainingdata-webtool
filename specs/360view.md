In these sessions, we will implement displaying the 360째 images that are displayed as spheres in the react-three-fiber viewport.  
The functionality is as follows:
- When clicking on a sphere,
  - The camera should move to the position of the sphere. The orbiting point of the camera should be very close to the new camera position.
  - There is new UI in the overlay (top left) that allows us to exit this state. When this is clicked, the camera returns to the original position and orbiting point.
  - An sphere of radios 0.05 is displayed at the position of the sphere.
    - The texture of this sphere is the texture of the 360째 image that is clicked.
    - The opacity of this sphere is 0.5


The goal in general is to have a functionality that allows us to check if the 360째 images are aligned correctly with the model.

For this, we will need to:
1. Add functionality to move the camera to a position in space. Add a button to the debug panel to move it to a random location to confirm this works.
2. When clicking a sphere, move the target there, and the camera 0.5cm from the target.
3. Implement the UI and store to go back to the original position.
4. Load the correct texture, and display it as a sphere map when in the 360째 view.
